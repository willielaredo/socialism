# media

I like to think about socialism in relation to sports: there are the players, the sports journalists: talk radio hosts, columnists, tv talk show hosts, etc. and the fans: the people who watch the games and the commentary and talk about it among themselves, calling into sports talk radio, posting on social media, etc. 

Most self-described socialists are fans. They confuse the radio hosts with the players and rarely acknowledge the actual players! 

This has been described as [political hobbyism](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/11/21172064/politics-is-for-power-eitan-hersh-the-ezra-klein-show) which seems like a compelling idea developed by [Eitan Hersh](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Politics-Is-for-Power/Eitan-Hersh/9781982116798). 
As the Ezra Klein sho notes desribe: 
>In his incisive new book Politics Is for Power, Hersh draws a sharp distinction between what he calls “political hobbyism” — following politics as a kind of entertainment and expression of self-identity — and the actual work of politics. His data show that a lot of people who believe they are doing politics are passively following it

So, what is "doing politics", what is "doing socialism"? Don't we want to know? That's why we're here, thinking about it. It's hard to know!
