# hobbyism vs doing socialism

If you think of socialism as a sports there are

- the players:
- the commentators: the sports journalists: talk radio hosts, columnists, tv talk show hosts, etc. 
- the fans: the people who watch the games and the commentary and talk about it among themselves, calling into sports talk radio, posting on social media, etc. 

Most self-described socialists are fans, especially on twitter. BUt instead of focusing on the players, they confuse the commentators with the players, and never even consider what it might be like to be a player themselves. 

This dynamic has been described as political hobbyism, developed by Eitan Hersh in [Politics is for Power](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Politics-Is-for-Power/Eitan-Hersh/9781982116798)

As the [Ezra Klein show notes](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/11/21172064/politics-is-for-power-eitan-hersh-the-ezra-klein-show) describe: 
>In his incisive new book Politics Is for Power, Hersh draws a sharp distinction between what he calls “political hobbyism” — following politics as a kind of entertainment and expression of self-identity — and the actual work of politics. His data show that a lot of people who believe they are doing politics are passively following it

From Hersh:

>Fandom is a central component of their political identity. They could enthusiasticly lend their support to a political party and its candidates without so much visceral emotion.

>But if politics is a sport, then the only way worth watching it is as a fan embracing the rivalry.

>We treat a neighbor as a distant villain not worthy of our time. The less we talk to him and interact with him, the more we can preserve a lazy form of political engagement where we purport to loathe people we don't know.

The big question then becomes, what does it mean to be a socialist player. To actually engage and "do socialism"? Socialism as verb, as action, as activity.
