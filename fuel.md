## The Fuel: the power that moves moves the vehicle forward

The fuel is organizing. Organizing people to make demands on the people in power in order to win concessions and ultimately wrest power. Making significant strides against capital and the state cannot be one with out the long hard grind of organizing a disciplined group of people to coordinate their voices and their bodies a focus on a singular goal, a milestone along the journey towards socialism. 

As Jane McAlevey says in *No Shortcuts*
>Only organizing can effectively challenge the gross inequality of power in the United States. Today, there is very little understanding of what factors lead to small, medium-, and high-impact victories, or why.

To produce the fuel, we need to understand the power we have and the power we need. To organize, first is to undertake a detailed power analysis of the ordinary people who are needed to make the change. They are bouncing around their lives, but exist somewhere in a bounded community that can be counted and whose power can be measured. This might be a precinct, a workplace, a congregation, a village. Everyone's energy is dissipated and chaotic until it is organized into a single movement where a super majority of people are coordinating their voices and their bodies. It's through talking to new people who haven't self-selected to join the movement that real power is generated.

Society is already organized, so the idea that socialists need to organized atomized individuals is not the real challenge. It's about identifying the organic leaders in the already existing organized constituencies (workplaces, churches, neighborhood associations, etc.) who can bring their base along with them if they join the struggle. 

Socialist organizations such as [[DSA]] and [[Socialist Alternative]] are vehicles that are fueled by self-selecting activists who work hard to mobilize other self-selecting activists who they have met at activist gatherings.
