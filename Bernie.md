# {{page.title}}

Is Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont a socialist? Or is he a social democrat? A New Deal Democrat? Does it matter. He calls himself, or at least did call himself a democratic socialist in 2015-16 during his run in the Democratic Party primary against Hillary Clinton. His identification with socialism both bolstered the movement, but also may have led to confusion about what socialism is, what it has been, and what it could be.
