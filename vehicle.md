## The Vehicle: Organization and Party

## Overview

We can start to classify socialist vehicles by type

- Political parties ([[Green Party]], [[Socialist Alternative]])
- Party-like organizations ([[DSA]])
- Syndicalist unions [[Industrial Workers of the World]]

- Cooperatives
  - Richard Wolff seems to be arguing 
    - that worker-cooperatives are the vehicle here, since the state's
      >chief goal would be to reproduce the worker cooperative organization of enterprises
    - but in a fleet with other vehicles like parties they would
      >go far in remedying the democratic deficiencies of party, state and society in actually existing socialisms

## Historical Vehicles

Workers councils
  - Are the modern examples? 

Communes/Utopian Societies
  - Are there modern examples?

Imagine yourself in a museum of cars, where you can walk through the exhibits from the earliest Model T Fords to the muscle cars of the 1970s. 

Just as the automobile has changed over time as new technologies are developed and more and more creative energy put into developing designs, the same is true for socialist vehicles. from the utopian communities of Fourier to the secret societies of Babeauf. 

The socialist and communist internationals, the first of which was started by Karl Marx have been seen as important vehicles, or meta-vehicles since they are comprised of smaller vehicles. The Internationals can be seen as fleets of vehicles. 

As working people gained the franchise, political parties were the vehicles.
