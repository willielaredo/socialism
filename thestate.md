So much political strategic direction comes down to faith in the government. 

If you have faith in the government such that it can serve as an democratic owner/controller of the economy, then you fight to gain control over it to wrest control of the economy from private capital. 

If you don't believe the structure of the government to be one that can be the deliverer of democratic socialism, then you ultimately need some other sort of structure to be your controller/owner. Workers councils, unions themselves, a command and control vanguard party organized like the military. 

The Zapatistas of course called it the mal gobierno and would have nothing to do with it whatsoever, but how could they? The civil rights of the indios were/are so abrogated and they are so oppressed that no engagement with the government was possible, much like a colonized/occupying force. This must be what communists and anarchists think of the bourgeosie state today: that it occupying the proletariat and nothing short of revolution can free the people and any collusion with the ruling class is as if the colonized were colluding with the colonizers, the slaves with the masters, etc.
