# The Destination

[This essay](https://catalyst-journal.com/2023/01/the-market-and-workplace-in-a-democratic-socialism) by Mike Beggs says it's
>intention is to sketch a plausible vision of a socialist economy without considering the problems of getting there from the present. 

A good example of looking solely at the destination without regard for the 
- vehicle
- fuel
- terrain
- itinerary

But Beggs here (and he says this is an outline of a forthcoming book: *The Blueprint: How Socialism Can Work in the Real World* (Verso, 2024), with coauthors Bhaskar Sunkara and Ben Burgis) tries to envision a *feasible* destination, not an unattainable horizon. 

It is a good question how many people would join the cause of socialism but for lack of a clear vision for what the destination is. 

Other destinations have been sketched by utopian novels, like Edward Bellamy's [*Looking Backward*](https://delong.typepad.com/files/bellamy-backward.pdf).
