# Social Democracy: is it socialist?

Sherie Berman is a leading thinker on social democracy, which by mid-twentieth century maintained "a focus on the control rather than the ownership of capital" [Berman](https://azadivaedalat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Understanding-Social-Democracy-Harward.pdf).

Does orthodox marxism belive that the state should not intervene in the economy? Berman makes that claim again and again [in this article](https://azadivaedalat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Understanding-Social-Democracy-Harward.pdf). That it shares with classical liberalism the belief that the economy drives history and should drive history and no attempts should be made at reform. 

Social Democracy per Berman:
>a belief in the primacy of politics and communitarianism, and [...] a distinctive and viable policy agenda based on cross-class appeals and a “people’s party” approach together with a commitment to using the state to control markets.

And per Keynes, social democracy held the belief that
>the state could reconcile the private ownership of the means of production with democratic management of the economy

Pre-War Socialism (that social democracy transplanted)
- goal: transcend capitalism entirely
- means: proletarian revolution (no cross-class political alliances)

1955 SDP policy: "as much competition as possible, as much planning as necessary"

Berman again, claiming social democracy as a vision of socialism    
>social democracy should be seen as a distinctive ideology and movement all its own, built on a belief in the primacy of politics and communitarianism and representing a non-Marxist vision of socialism
