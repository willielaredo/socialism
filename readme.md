**👋 We're all doing our best to figure it out, right?**

## It's complicated...

It's a contested word that has meant a lot of different things to different people over the world and across time. And I think about it differently as time goes on and the objective social conditions change. 

Socialism doesn't exist divorced from institutions and politics, as pure theory or ideology. The idea of socialism is intertwined with the activity of socialism, dialectically you might say.

To ask "what is socialism?" may be the same as asking "what do socialists do?" [[Lenin]] wrote a famous book called "What is to be done?" and while I don't identify as a Leninist (and have not read that book), I ask myself this question a lot. 

Possible areas of socialist exploration:
- Campaigns
  - Winnable reforms in the here and now: are they socialist? 
- Organizations/Tendencies/Parties
  - How to get there: the vehicles we ride in and the roads we ride on
- Models
  - How will we recognize socialism if we see it? Should we think about what it might look like?
- History
  - How have people answered the question in the past?
- The Labor question
  - What's the relationship between the labor movement and socialism?
- So many words! 
  - The role of [[media]] in socialism

## Why this site?

If writing is thinking, then this is a forum for me to think. Publishing it to the world wide web forces me to be more careful and clear than I would be if I were writing only for myself.

This site aligns with the digital garden concept as explained by [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history):
> Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis. A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.

Taking this exploratory rather than explanatory approach is likely to bring up more questions than it answers!

## Who am I?

I've been a [[DSA]] member since 2014. I coordinated a [[Jacobin reading group]] (2014-15), attended two DSA national conventions (2015, 2017) and served on the executive committee of a DSA chapter (2018 and 2020). I helped scan back issues of [[Democratic Left]] and [[New American Movement]] publications to create the digital archive that you can find on the [DL website](https://democraticleft.dsausa.org/issues/page/18/).

A related side project of mine is [left.guide](https://left.guide), which tried to answer this question in a more quantitative and taxonomical way.
