# What is Socialism?

**ðŸ‘‹ We're all doing our best to figure it**

## What is this site?

This is my effort to think through this question. It's a contested word that has meant a lot of different things to different people over the world and across time. As I think about it more, instead of becoming more clear, it often gets more murky and cloudy. 

It's halfway between a blog and a note-taking site. I'm not sure I totally love the idea of a [[digital garden]] but I guess that's what this is.

I've never written for publication, and like the idea that this site will change and grow and be mutable, malleable, and always a work in progress.
