**ðŸ‘‹ We're all doing our best to figure it out, right?**

It's a contested word that has meant a lot of different things to different people over the world and across time. And I think about it differently as time goes on and the objective social conditions change. 

Socialism doesn't exist divorced from institutions and politics, as pure theory or ideology. The idea of socialism is intertwined with the activity of socialism, dialectically you might say.

## Why publish this site?

If writing is thinking, then this is a forum for me to think through the question. Publishing it to the world wide web forces me to be more careful and clear than I would be if were writing only for myself.

I'm taking an exploratory rather than a explanatory approach, so the project is likely to bring up more questions than it answers!

It's halfway between a wiki and a note-taking site--it seems to align with the [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) concept.

## Who am I?

I've been a [[DSA]] member since 2014. I coordinated a [[Jacobin reading group]] (2014-15), attended two DSA national conventions (2015, 2017) and served on the executive committees of a DSA chapter (2018 and 2020). I helped scan back issues of [[Democratic Left]] and [[New American Movement]] publications to create the digital archive that you can find on the [DL website](https://democraticleft.dsausa.org/issues/page/18/).
