# What is Socialism?

**ðŸ‘‹ We're all doing our best to figure it out, right?**

## What is this site?

This is my effort to think through this question. 

It's halfway between a blog and a note-taking site. I'm not sure I totally love the idea of a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) but I guess that's what this is.

This site will be mutable, malleable, and always a work in progress. 

## So, what is socialism?

It's a contested word that has meant a lot of different things to different people over the world and across time. And I think about it differently as time goes on and the objective social conditions change. 

Socialism doesn't exist divorced from institutions and politics, as pure theory or ideology. The idea of socialism is intertwined with the activity of socialism, dialectically you might say.

## Who am I?

I've been a [[DSA]] member and [[Jacobin]] subscriber since 2014. I coordinated Jacobin reading group in the pre-[[Bernie]] days 2014-15 and have served on the executive committees for DSA chapters and attended two DSA national conventions in 2015 & 2017. 

What if I link to [[note-properties]]
