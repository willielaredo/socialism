# The vehicle metaphor
I like this metaphor because its relatable and acknowledges that all five areas are required for us to be successful. Division of labor is ok! People can choose which aspect of the work most appeals to them and we can decide collectively if we have enough people working on each aspect of the effort. This is all contestable and recognizes there's also the meta work of determining that, ok we have enough fuel to get where we need to go, let's focus a bit more on mapping, because the road ahead is unmapped and we'll be getting there soon and will need to know which direction to go and what to expect when we get there.
