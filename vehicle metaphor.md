# The vehicle metaphor
I like this metaphor because its relatable and acknowledges that all five areas are required for us to be successful. Division of labor is ok! People can choose which aspect of the work most appeals to them and we can decide collectively if we have enough people working on each aspect of the effort. This is all contestable and recognizes there's also the meta work of determining that, ok we have enough fuel to get where we need to go, let's focus a bit more on mapping, because the road ahead is unmapped and we'll be getting there soon and will need to know which direction to go and what to expect when we get there. 

Bellamy in *Looking Backward* uses the vehicle metaphor for capitalism
>In the first chapter of his utopian fiction, for example, Bellamy portrays capitalist society as ‘a prodigious coach’, surmounted by affluent passengers on ‘breezy and comfortable’ seats, ‘which the masses of humanity were harnessed to and dragged toilsomely along a very hilly and sandy road’ (p. 6). *(quoted in oxford edition introduction p. xiii)*

Other vehicle metaphors use trains: 

- Benjamin's locomotive of history and the e-brake of revolution
- Snowpiercer
